Part 1 - 

*** I did run into some trouble with my part one but i was able to fix the problem after i got a fresh eye to look at the code together. And together we were able to point out the issue. I did not copy but i was able to fix a small minor error by just getting a fresh eye. Also i did run into link issues but i solved that by creating a new project and new files on my Desktop and just copy and past the same code from the old project and it was successful**

Part 2 - 

** I didnt run into any issues and was able to understand what i was able to do by googling some concept that i didnt under properly and also referred back on the course note. **

But am going to talk about the Fuction and what they do. 

  The three functions belong to a train class and they play a role in managing and also updating the information about the train.

The first function 
bool Train::load(int& notBoarded) - is responsible for loading passengers onto a train. and it relies on the user inpit to function. 
it promotes the user for the number of passengers and update the passenger counts
it checks if the total number of passengegers after boarding is within valid limits


  The second function 
bool Train::updateDepartureTime() - allows the user to update the depature time of the train. It prompts the user to input a new departure time.
It validates the input using the validTime function.
If the input is valid, it updates the departure time of the train.
If the input is not valid, it sets the departure time to -1 as an indicator.
The function returns a boolean indicating whether the departure time update was successful.

  The last function 
bool Train::transfer(const Train& from) - Transfering passengers from one train to another while also combining the names of both trains.
